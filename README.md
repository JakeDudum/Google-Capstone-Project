# Google-Capstone-Project

This is the GitHub Repo for my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. It contains all relevant data used and the case study created in R Studio. If you wish to recreate my work and findings you can do so by first going to https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and downloading the divvy trip data begining with the file named 202207-divvy-tripdata.zip all the way to 202306-divvy-tripdata.zip which are the csv files used in my analysis. You will need to extract all csv files into your working R Studio workspace and follow the naming conventions I used by renaming the files to match the ones in my R markdown file (ex. 202207-divvy-tripdata.csv was renamed to 2022-07.csv ). Then you can clone this repo, copy over the Capstone.Rmd file into your R Studio workspace and then run the file to reproduce my analysis.
